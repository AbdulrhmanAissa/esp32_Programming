# esp32_Programming

The first task that we did in campus with Smart Methods in the internship was to program an esp32 chip.

in the beginning, we started by installing the Arduino IDE on our laptop from the link: https://www.arduino.cc/en/software

Next, it was required to download all the dependincies and the libraries by adding the link: https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_ESP32_index.json in the board managment. Which will allow us to find the the name of our chip and choose it.

Thirdly, we connected the esp32 chip to the laptop and choose the right port, either COM3 or COM4.

Next, we wrote the code in the Arduino IDE to upload it on the esp32 chip.

Finally, We uploaded the code on the chip and then checked if it was working properly and the led is static.
